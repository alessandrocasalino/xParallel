# xParallel
A simple package for parallel evaluations of xAct.

This package provides a very simple framework to implement parallization functions in xAct.
Most of the functions are devoted to define the xAct objects (manifold, metric, etc..) on the available Mathematica kernels, which you can use on your own parallelized functions or in some of the already available ones (ParallelCovD, etc..).

## Installation

You can install the package following the xAct instructions

http://www.xact.es/download/install

The xParallel folder should be placed inside the xAct folder, at the same level of xTensor/xPert/etc.. folders.

## Usage

An folder with some examples is provided is provided.
At the moment I am not able to test xParallel on a large number of kernels due to licence limitations.
